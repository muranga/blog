Imagine a normal day after work while you a working on your favorite side project and you decide to add a new step to the [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) job for your project. 
The new task requires you to install some system packages on the CI for example you now need nodejs installed on the jenkins . 
The first thing would be to SSH into the server and install the package , but that is when you realise that you can't access the server via SSH anymore because your jenkins box has been running without any issues for a few years and when you set it up you did not do a good job of storing the password for the SSH user you setup so you are locked out.

That is the situation I found myself in a few days ago. I tried several things even trying to get my service provider to get into the server and change the password for me , but that did not work out (it was taking too long to get feedback).
My next approach was to try and see if I could install a Jenkins plugin to provide the needed functionalilty and as much as there are many Jenkins plugins out there I failed to find one the worked for me.
While I was looking for a plugin I found a plugin for [backup](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Backup+Plugin) called [Backup Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Backup+Plugin), which allows you to backup your entire jenkins configuration. 
I quickly went into the Jenkins settings under the plugins section and installed the plugin.

Once I had the plugin installed , I followed the newly added Backup Manager Link in the Jenkins Settings and then went to setup and configured it to create a backup in the workspace of one of the jobs I had setup.

I added gradle, rubyenv and android folders to the custom exclusions list so that I could keep the backup quick and small.

When I run the backup , from the backup manager , it created a tarball in the workspace for the test-job that way I was able to download it.

After downloading I begun setting up a new instance of Jenkins, after Jenkins was installed I installed the Backup Plugin on the new instance and copied the configuration tarball to the server and stored it in the backups folder.

Once the backup plugin was installed I configured the Backup Directory to /backups. 
When I navigated back to the Backup Manager under restore , the backup I had made from the old server was available and I restored it onto the Jenkins instance.
Jenkins restarted and immediately asked me to login and when I tried my old credentials they worked instantly .

I went ahead and reinstalled all the plugins I had installed on the old server and I had a new instance of Jenkins with all my old jobs setup.
